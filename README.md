We have created a project that consists in making the alphabot perform basic movements such as forward, backward, left, right and more complex movements, and in this repository you will find all the files we used in this project.

| db_movimenti.db  | This is the database containing the various movements that the aplhabot must perform
| server.py | The file server must be inserted in the alphabot so that it can receive commands with various movements from the client
