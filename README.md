We have created a project that consists in making the alphabot perform basic movements such as forward, backward, left, right and more complex movements, and in this repository you will find all the files we used in this project.


# Files description

| Name of the file     | Description                        
| :-------- | :--------------------------------- 
| Alphabot.py  | This class alllows allows you to use the Alphabot correctly
| client.py  | The client file is used to choose which movements the Alphabot should make and must be used on your device
| db_movimenti.db  | This is the database containing the various movements that the aplhabot must perform
| server.py | The file server must be inserted in the alphabot so that it can receive commands with various movements from the client

Within our project we also used programs such as putty ![image](https://github.com/thecodebuzz/FileSizePOC/blob/master/TheCodebuzz.png?raw=true) and WinSCP to transfer the file server to the alphabot
